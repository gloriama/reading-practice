Scripts to practice reading kanji/hanzi

This repo contains scripts to help practice memorizing kanji pronunciations.

## Quick start

Using a text editor, add terms to `ANSWERS.txt`, one per line, with the following format:
```
(kanji term)ã€€(pronunciation, e.g. in hiragana)
```
Note that the separator space is the Japanese space character.

```
node generate
```

Open `OUTPUT.txt` in any text editor, and type in the correct pronunciations. Save the file.

```
node check
```
